        <h4> Epiquria </h4>

        <hr>
        <h5>I have visited this place on 24th May 2021</h5>
        <p>A beautiful place to visit with family & friends on a beautiful evening! and,If you wanna see a movie a
          solution for that too!in front the epiquria mall there's a movie theatre so this gives you a movie+food
          +relaxation free! it's just a 3 in one package.On every 31st December night all the people come at the place
          and do a party and when its 12 all the people shout together! HAPPY NEW YEAR!! and this gives an icing to the
          cake.Overall my experience with the Epicuria is just amazing.</p>
